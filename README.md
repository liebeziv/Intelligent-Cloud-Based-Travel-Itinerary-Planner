###  Core Features
- **Intelligent Recommendations**: Personalized attraction recommendations based on user preferences and real-time data
- **Dynamic Adjustments**: Automatic itinerary optimization based on weather changes and real-time conditions
- **Route Planning**: Intelligent travel route optimization algorithms
- **Real-time Data**: Integration of weather, traffic, and local activity information
- **Cloud Security**: Enterprise-level cloud security protection and data encryption

###  Project Highlights
-  **AI-Driven**: Machine learning recommendation algorithms
-  **Cloud-Native**: Complete AWS cloud service architecture
-  **Security-First**: Multi-layer cloud security protection system
-  **Responsive**: Support for desktop and mobile access
-  **Real-time**: Dynamic data updates and itinerary adjustments
